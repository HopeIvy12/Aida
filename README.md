# **Aida**  
**An AI-supported assistant** designed to help individuals navigate and find solutions to food insecurity with ease.

## **Description**  
Aida was created to support those facing food insecurity, helping individuals find accessible food resources and information. From personal experience, accessing food bank information can be overwhelming and stressful, especially with 9.3M adults in the UK experiencing food insecurity in 2023. Aida aims to simplify that process by offering tailored and personalized guidance to food resources, making it easier to get the help needed.

Powered by **Pinecone**, a cloud-based vector database, Aida provides relevant, dynamic, and easy-to-access information to those in need.

- **TypeScript**  
- **Tailwind CSS**  
- **Pinecone** (cloud-based vector database)
